# Purpose

Check out the website [HERE](https://hanhuazhu.github.io)

This project's main function is a creative outlet. It is meant to showcase my skills and capabilities in a tangible/visual sense to potential employers.

At the moment, it only holds placeholder content/projects and my contact information.

# Implementation

The project was bootstrapped with facebook's create-react-app.

I tried to use BEM naming conventions alongside webpack to make my components more isolated and reusable on a javascript level.

React-router is used to provide a multi-page layout, where each page is treated as a component.

# What's Next

I plan to continue working on this webpage and adding more complexity as I build up the knowledge necessary for further features.
